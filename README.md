# Homework #24 Cycles and conditions

1. Ask the user for a five-digit number and determine if it is a palindrome.
2. Ask the user for the purchase amount and print the amount to be paid with a discount:
    from 200 to 300 - the discount will be 3%; 
    from 300 to 500 - 5%;
    from 500 and above - 7%.
3. Ask the user for 10 numbers and count how many positive, negative, and zeroes they entered. Also count how many of them are even and odd. Display the statistics on the screen. Keep in mind that one variable (not 10) is enough for the user to enter numbers.
4. Loop the display of days of the week as follows: "Day of the week. Do you want to see the next day?" and so on until the user clicks OK.
